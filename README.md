# Snakes
This is the PC version of the snakes game which was quite popular on old Nokia phones about a decade ago. 
I've coded it in C, ofcourse, with my own rules. It makes use of pointers extensively. I suggest you to download the compiler
that is here in the repository as the compiler needs to be configured to use the graphics.h header file and the process of
configuring it is cumbersome.
